# Shazam de Vin - Ionic Mobile App

Shazam de Vin is an innovative mobile application that leverages OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to identify the name of wines and beverages from their labels. Built with Ionic, this app provides a convenient way for users to quickly scan and recognize the brand and name of their drink of choice.

## Key Features:

- **OCR Scanning**: Users can take a picture of the wine or beverage label, and the app will use OCR to extract text information from the image.
- **Information Retrieval**: After scanning, the app displays relevant details such as the wine's name, type, and possibly pairing suggestions or ratings.

The application is developed using Ionic, a powerful SDK for building cross-platform mobile apps with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

## How to Use:

1. Open the app on your mobile device.
2. Point the camera at the wine or beverage label.
3. Take a photo, and the app will process the image to extract the name.
4. View the extracted information and explore more about the wine.
